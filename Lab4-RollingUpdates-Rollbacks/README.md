As a Kubernetes administrator for the weather app team, you have managed the app in the Kubernetes cluster. We have a new app version with new features and bug fixes. The existing deployment in the Kubernetes needs to be updated with this latest version. However, the deployment needs to be executed without causing any downtime. To achieve this, our team's architect has recommended using Kubernetes deployment strategies such as rollout and rollback. These strategies enable you to apply changes sequentially without causing any disruption to the application's users.

To complete this task, you will need access to the app's container images (codewithpraveen/labs-k8s-rolling-update:1.0 and codewithpraveen/labs-k8s-rolling-update:2.0), which are available in the Docker Hub. Additionally, a Kubernetes cluster with a single node has already been provisioned. You must leverage the Kubernetes command-line tools and APIs to deploy the app's initial version, roll out new features, verify the features, and roll back the deployment if the app fails to work as expected. The initial version, v1, supports GET and POST for weather collection at the URL localhost:80/api/v1/weather. It is enhanced in v2 to support DELETE for an individual weather item at the URL localhost:80/api/v2/weather/{id}.
