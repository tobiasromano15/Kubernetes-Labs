In this lab, you will be working as a DevOps engineer at Sample Company Corp. Currently the organization is running and maintaining the applications in the form of Docker containers within the production environment. All of the steps are completed manually - creating containers, rolling updates, and rolling back changes. As you can imagine, this leads to many errors and is rather time-consuming. The Technology Partner has recommended using a Container Orchestration Tool that allows developers to quickly deploy and maintain a steady state of their application with easy rolling updates and rollback of changes. The tool of recommendation is Kubernetes. Being the DevOps engineer at the company, your boss has assigned you the task of creating a Proof of Concept based on Kubernetes features that can solve the use case.
